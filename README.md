## Prune and Quantize ML models


### Installation

```pip install .``` for regular install, ```pip install -e .``` if you wish to install as a local editable package
To run the code, [HGQ2](https://github.com/calad0i/HGQ2) is also needed. For now it only has local install available, so download the repository and install it locally.
